# Special Works - Project 5 - Minimum Driving Distance

[![Introduction Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/-3klc9kqb8Q/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/-3klc9kqb8Q "YouTube Video")

**Scenario**

A client that has presented you with a CSV of coordinates (addresses that have already been geocoded, but are anonymized) and wants to know the shortest driving distance (in miles) between each pair of points (i.e., create a minimum driving distance matrix). 
They want to know if the process can be automated and need an explanation of the procedure for their thesis. 

The CSV, [advgis_mdd.csv](#), is provided here as well as on ArcGIS Online ([advgis_mdd.csv](https://wm-gis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=85ef209e191b41419ca555492c60935a)).

**Basic Level**

Create a minimum driving distance matrix between each set of points given.
Be sure to maintain the IDs that are associated with each of the locations.

Export your solution as a CSV file.
