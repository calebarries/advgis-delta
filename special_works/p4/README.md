# Special Works - Project 4 - Geocoding
![Introduction Video](# "Introduction Video")

**Scenario**

A study by [Shalowitz et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygyno.2015.04.025) suggests that a total of 36% of US counties are > 50 miles from the closest gynecologic oncologist, which results in approximately 9% of the US female population (14.8 million women) experiencing geographic barriers to high-quality gynecologic cancer treatment centers.
An independent research group is looking to see whether these numbers (percent counties and percent female population) have increased, decreased or stayed relatively the same since this paper was published.
One part of that work is getting a map of gynecologic oncologist treatment centers.

The only information you are given is a web address to:

* https://specialist.foundationforwomenscancer.org/

**Basic Level**

Get addresses from this website, geocode them, and create a spatial point-data layer in GeoJSON file format.
Be sure to keep track of all methods, datasets, processes, tools, references, etc.

**Intermediate Level**

In addition to the Basic Level, also create a map of all the US counties that have a gynecologic oncologist office or care center.

**Advanced Level**

_For GIS 520 students._

See if you can provide an answer for the independent research group.

Are the numbers increasing, decreasing or staying about the same?
