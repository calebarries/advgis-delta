# Special Works Projects
This folder contains the specials works projects you are expected to solve together.
Remember, you will have to present two solutions; however, you don't know which two you will be solving (yet).
Each special works project has its own folder with a README that includes links to an introduction video, GitHub discussion and a shared Google doc.

* The discussion board provides a time-stamped chronology of questions and answers.
* Use the Google doc for real-time collaboration, as you can simultaneously edit, reorganize, comment, and share ideas.

There may be tiered levels for completion.
Consider the "Basic Level" for "Fully Meets Expectations" and the "Intermediate Level" for "Exceeds Expectations" (GIS 420 students) or "Advanced Level" for "Exceeds Expectations" (GIS 520 students).
