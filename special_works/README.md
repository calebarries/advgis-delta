# Special Works Projects
This folder contains the specials works projects you are expected to solve together.
Each special works project has its own folder with a README that includes links to a GitHub issue and a shared Google doc.

* You may treat the linked issue as a discussion board, which provides a time-stamped chronology of questions and answers.
* Use the Google doc for collaboration, as you can simultaneously edit, reorganize, comment, and share ideas.
