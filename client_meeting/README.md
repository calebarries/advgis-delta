**Literature review and finding data**

* If you can not find the exact data used in your paper, we suggest the following:
* Choose a different paper with more accessible data
* Think outside of the box! Meaning, consider using similar data for another study area. This way you can still carry out the methodology 
* DO NOT spend all of you time looking for data. The point of this project is to see if the process is repeatable. If you spend all of your time on the data search, there won’t be enough time to test the process.

> Note: Unfinished analysis is okay, as long as you can justify it. 
> If the analysis is tedious that's fine. 
If your project is unfinished because you simply don’t have enough time to do it, that’s okay! 
No one expects you to carry out a publishable project in the short time frame.

**Time management and documentation**

* Figure out a general timeline early on to allow time for the different aspects of the project
* Keep track of time spent on each process - this might be helpful in your client meeting
* Keep track of tools used, sources, geoprocessing, etc.

**Client meetings**

* Explain the purpose of the study and any other relevant knowledge your client should know to understand your project.
* Assume the client has no GIS knowledge--Explain everything you did!
* Make sure everyone in the group speaks
* Links to data / sources throughout the presentation
* Address any issues you had during the project both with data, analysis, technology, and working as a group
* Come to the meeting with a final product - Websites, powerpoints, StoryMaps, other types of presentation all work well

The client meeting is a way to show off what you have learned and done. 
We are here to learn about your project, not criticize. 
Be confident and proud of your work!
