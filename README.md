# Welcome
This is the delta version of Advanced GIS (Spring 2021).

### Overview
I plan to utilize GitHub as our main repository for this course. 
If you have never used GitHub before, don't worry, I only plan to use a limited amount of GitHub's capabilities, namely: a place for sharing documents (Code), a place for tracking questions and answers (Issues), and place for group conversations (Discussions).

First, when you log in, you should see a welcome screen that includes a list of the repositories you have access to and the teams in which you are a member.
Everyone in the Spring 2021 class is a member of the [delta-squad](https://github.com/orgs/cga-wm/teams/delta-squad) team.
This team is in charge of the [advgis-delta](https://github.com/cga-wm/advgis-delta) repository, a cloud-based storage for documents (Code), issue tracking (Issues), discussions (Discussions), and a wiki (Wiki).

My plan is to use: 

* the Code segment of this repository to communicate resources and instructions.
* the Issues for tracking questions that need answers (e.g. how to's, demo's, tutorials, quick-fixes, yes/no's, etc.)
* the Discussions for communicating ideas; we have daily topics that you will contribute towards on a weekly basis
* the Wiki for something; I haven't thought of a use for it yet, but I might.

Please familiarize yourself with this web interface.
All textual elements (including comments and discussions) use Markdown syntax, so you can embellish your responses with **bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, as well as create ordered (numbered) and unordered lists, tables, and embed images or links.
See Resources links below for more.
